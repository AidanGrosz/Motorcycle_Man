### Sporster:
- All Major Cosmetic/ design work has been acomplished, with the only regret being the use of such dark colors. While in the sun the "Ghost Pearl" Base coat does pop without direct sunlight the motorcycle looks dull. This is normal for darker base coats, some people enjoy it, others don't.
### Misc Shop Skills:
- Major Improvements to my paint booth have been made, including the addition of taped tarps to lower foreign material intrusion as well as lowering the Air entrance to maintain still air where the paint will be hitting the surface. I will also be including the use of a 5000 BTU Air Conditioner system to allow for painting on hotter days. This of course requires fixing an older window unit which will be documented
- Picked up Sand Blasting as a new skill as well as all required material.
- Dialed down on Aluminum Polishing learning the in's and out's required to make spectacular surfaces. Detailed Guide will be posted.
- Practiced a lot of Painting, dialing down coat thickness, coat skills, and simple tips. All will be posted.
- Various Community Repairs which often take the majority of my time, will document this process as well.
### Electra-Glide:
- Finished the build and was able to sell it for the asking price!
### RECENT EVENTS
-  I did want to breifly touch on some various projects I am working through at the moment. The first includes WOT issues on a 1985 Merucry 7.5 hp Outboard Motor. This is a 2-stroke that I have had previous experince on before for other clients and one intresting design "flaw" is a removable Venturi in the throat of the carbuerator. In theory this made it easier on the manufacturing team as they wouldn't have to redesign carbs for differnt Horse Power outboards, instead just insert a differnt plastic peice in the same carbuerator. Why this is a flaw is because it breaks and destorys engines. Luckily this didn't happen for this particular clients outboard, instead it has just been loss. Most people mis-diagnose this as a clogged carbuerator when it reality its due to the lack of the venturi to help with atomization at WOT.
-  Also these particular OutBoards require a closed choke to ease cold starts. The operator must adjust the choke to be fully closed when attempting to start, if even open a sliver there will be issues ----> Hard Starting!

When my client told me his 4-wheeler was having issues when revved up, I knew exactly what it was. An old saying I have been taught to treat as holy is, "It is always the carburetor until it's not." This quote has held true 100% of the time. Getting technical, the carburetor relies on a physical phenomenon called the Venturi effect, in which we can restrict the movement of air to create a low-pressure zone. Doing this allows us to create a vacuum in which we can draw fuel in through tiny little straws we call "jets." As the fuel is pulled, it atomizes, mixes with air, and makes its way to the combustion chamber to be burned. We can have multiple venturis in the carburetor; the main two are first in the throat of the carb and the next at the throttle plate. This then gives us two main circuits: the idle and high-speed circuits. There is a small needle that sits within the main jet (the jet that controls the high-speed circuit) that gives us control over our midrange speeds. Usually, when an engine is running fine at idle but dies or bogs at high RPM, that is because the high-speed circuit is clogged. In the case of this 4-wheeler, the customer allowed the carburetor to sit full of ethanol fuel for over a year, allowing the fuel to solidify into a gel-like substance that can be seen above. This then clogged the jets, leading to the issues they were experiencing.

Here is a closer view of all the carburetor parts. As you can see, it's relatively simple. After cleaning and reassembling the carburetor, the 4-wheeler ran smoothly. There was a bit of tuning required with the fuel/air screw that controls the idle mixture, but this was done quickly.

Very easy swap job done in less then 30 minuets.

**01/06/2025 Update**

Hello all viewers, this is the first post of many. The idea of this website is to show you all what I do, which I explain in more detail in the about section. Understand there is a lot that I won't post as the work I do can get very deep. As always, if interested, reach out to me for more information and help with whatever projects you all may be working on!

### Goals:
- Finish radiator on Chevy Sonic for client
- Spray base/clear coat on rear fender for Harley Sportster build
- Sand gas tank flat and remove dents for Harley Sportster build
- Design painting stand for all parts

### Accomplished:
- Radiator
- Spray painting (but there were issues)
- Sanding/removing dents (on GitHub)
- Design painting stand

Unfortunaly I did not take any photos for today except for my painting stand:
