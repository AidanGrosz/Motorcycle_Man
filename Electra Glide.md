## The Journey: 
This motorcycle originally came to me after a coworker reached out, asking me to fix his Harley Davidson. He knew I was passionate about building Harleys. Unfortunately, he left the bike sitting outside, exposed to the elements, which ruined its paint, chrome, and aluminum. Needless to say, the bike was a mess. My coworker simply asked me to get it started and running, as he had loaned it to a friend who returned it non-functional.

Whenever a vehicle doesn't run, my mind immediately jumps to either the ignition or fuel systems. This bike was fuel-injected, though a very primitive version of fuel injection. It was from a time before feedback systems, so as long as I could confirm that the injectors were delivering fuel, I could focus on the ignition system.

The first thing I check on any vehicle that hasn't run in a while is the oil pressure. If there's no oil pressure and you're cranking the engine to diagnose the problem, you risk causing significant damage. Unfortunately, this bike didn't build any oil pressure, even after cranking it for a few seconds with starting fluid. This meant that before I could even attempt to start the bike, I had to address the oil pressure issue.

I took apart the cam chest and inspected the oil pump. Harley-Davidson uses reliable Gerotor oil pumps that ride on the crankshaft. In most Harleys, the oil sump is located above the pump, so the oil is gravity-fed, and the pump doesn't need to generate a vacuum to pull the oil. This is different on touring models, where the oil sump sits below the 5-speed transmission, and the pump must pull oil from the sump.

After inspecting the oil pump, which was brand new, it became clear that someone else had already worked on the bike but couldn't resolve the oil pressure issue. I ruled out the pump as the cause and checked the lines for blockages, but none were found. Running out of possibilities, I then inspected the cam plate, where the Gerotor pump's supply side rides. To my dismay, I found deep grooves and etches in the cam plate, caused by dirty oil. These grooves prevented the pump from generating the necessary vacuum to pull oil from the sump. This wouldn't have been an issue if the sump were above the pump, but it was not.

To prevent this issue in the future, I sourced an aftermarket pump with a metal sheet between the cam plate and the rotor. This design allows the rotor to wear on the metal sheet instead of the expensive cam plate.

Once I resolved the oil pressure problem, I was able to diagnose the rest of the bike. I discovered that a clogged fuel line was causing inadequate fuel delivery, preventing the engine from starting. After fixing the fuel issue, I was able to get the Harley running and returned it to my coworker.

But that's not the end of the story. My coworker had no real interest in motorcycles and decided to trade the Harley to me for a 1965 Mustang I was actively restoring. I took the trade and decided to fully restore the motorcycle to its former glory. This included a top-end engine rebuild, new chrome parts, a redesign of the exhaust system, and diagnosing the radio system.

I am now in the final stages of the restoration, polishing aluminum parts, designing the new exhaust system, and troubleshooting the radio system.

As You can see from these photos the bike I got was in very rough shape, ruined alumium, peeling chrome and dull paint. Being able to "polish a turd" is a HUGE part of motorcycle restoration. To repaint this motorcycle it would take unessecary labor and money that could be avoided with a bit of buffing knowledge.

Harley engines have a very simple design. They feature two separate cylinder heads and push rods, which means the labor required for a top-end job is relatively minimal—this is one reason I tend to do them so often.

There are two main advantages to pulling the jugs. First, you can polish the bare aluminum fins that surround the cylinder heads and jugs. Second, you can replace both the base gasket and head gasket. Evolution engines were prone to oil leaks around the base gaskets because they were made of paper. As the motor heated up and the aluminum expanded, the gaskets would often stretch or even split. Twin Cam engines addressed this by using a rubber O-ring.

Fuel-injected Twin Cams are known for running hot due to an overly lean mixture, which can cause warped heads and jugs. I knew this bike was running very lean, so I wanted to ensure the heads and jugs were still flat—another key reason for doing the top-end job.

This is the finished result of the engine, and I’m very happy with how it turned out. I replaced the old, peeling chrome parts with new (to me) ones. I’m still sourcing parts for the exhaust, but aside from that, the engine is ready to be started and broken in.

As you can see, I live with my work—literally. This is the finished result of all the buffing, restoring that classic Harley Davidson shine.

Speaking of shine, this is the result of my aluminum polishing. I still have some work to do on my technique, but I’m getting closer to achieving that beautiful mirror-like finish on the aluminum.

As for now, that’s all I have for the Electra Glide project. I don’t have images of redoing the rear suspension, polishing the front forks, bolts, and diagnosing the radio system, but those are coming soon. Hopefully, we’ll have this Hog running by the end of January. I’ll go ahead and order the new headers now!
