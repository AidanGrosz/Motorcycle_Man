## Carburetors (Carbs)

I wanted to make this page dedicated to telling others what I wish someone had told me. I also dislike watching videos on things because they are usually way too drawn out and include useless information. Anyhow, this section is dedicated to teaching everyone about carbs. The importance behind this is that carbs account for most issues you will have on your small engines—anything from black smoke to popping in your exhaust system. A classic carburetor symptom is when the engine may idle properly or run correctly in some RPM range, but when taken out of that range, it begins to stumble or die.

**NOTE THAT THE EASIEST WAY TO PREVENT CARB ISSUES IS BY CHANGING THE AIR FILTER, FUEL FILTER, AND RUNNING NON-ETHANOL FUEL!**

Anyhow, let me give you some context on how carburetors actually work. Carburetors rely on a principle known as the Venturi Effect, which is basically a fancy way of saying that when we restrict the flow of air or any fluid, it will do two important things. First, the velocity (speed) of the fluid or air (in our case, I will be referring to air, as that’s what carbs deal with) increases, and a low-pressure zone is created where the constraint occurs.

Now, it's important to note that this is a low-pressure zone compared to atmospheric pressure. We will skip over the speed effect for right now, as that’s less important, but refer back to this low-pressure zone. 

### Carburetor Body and Bowl

The carburetor is comprised of two main sections: the body and the bowl. The body (shown below) is further comprised of many passages within the aluminum. These passages serve as tubes providing a direct path from the fuel (that's kept in the bowl) to these low-pressure zones created in two main areas. This is a very important concept to understand, as this is the principle on which carbs function.

Air is restricted in two main areas. First, is the constriction in the casting of the carb body. You can see this in the photo below, where one end is very wide, the other end is also wide, but the middle is much smaller. This provides a constriction of air, which creates an area of low pressure. 

The second constriction is actually the throttle plate. Depending on how “open” the throttle is, a low-pressure zone is created. For example, at idle, when you have a fully closed throttle, the air is severely restricted, causing a very strong “vacuum” (a fancy way of saying an area of low pressure). There are conveniently small holes connected to the passages right near the throttle plate that utilize this low pressure to draw fuel from the bowl, which is then delivered to the engine.

As you gradually open the throttle, the plate continually restricts the air less and less. While this happens, the low-pressure area becomes less apparent, but the natural constriction in the carb body becomes more pronounced, leading to the low-pressure zone being in the middle of the carb body instead of near the throttle plate. Conveniently, there are holes there as well that allow fuel to travel.

It is important to note that fuel is still being drawn by the small holes near the throttle plate, but not enough to consider. This brings the concept of circuits into the picture. Whenever anyone talks about a carburetor fuel circuit, they are referring to where this area of low pressure is more pronounced. Where it gets complicated is that these circuits also heavily overlap, but there are two circuits in which the effects of the other circuits aren't apparent. 

### The Three Main Circuits

The first circuit is your idle circuit. The throttle plate is completely closed, and almost all your fuel is moving through the small holes near the throttle plate. The next is your wide-open throttle circuit. At this time, the throttle is completely open, causing the majority of your fuel to come from the holes near the middle of the carb body. 

Now is a good time to discuss how the fuel is actually metered, and it’s done using these small straw-like things called “Jets.” The jets come in different sizes, which effectively limit the amount of fuel that can be drawn in. There are two main jets: the pilot jet, which controls your low-speed circuits, and the main jet, which controls your high-speed circuits.

It’s worth mentioning that there’s another important element for fuel metering at mid-range speeds. Whenever you aren’t going full speed or idling, your pilot jet is working with something known as your velocity needle. This needle sits in the passage leading to your main jet (also called the emulsion tube, which is a fancy version of these passages). As you gradually open the throttle, this needle slides up, allowing more and more fuel to be delivered from the main jet as the low-pressure zone in the middle of the carb body (this natural constraint we discussed above) increases.

So now we’ve discussed the three main circuits: idle, low speed, midrange, and wide open. It’s important to note that the mid-range circuit is heavily influenced by the pilot jet. Most of the time, in normal driving scenarios, you will mostly be pulling heavily from the idle circuit and midrange circuit.

### Idle Fuel Screw

Another thing I must mention is the effect of the idle fuel screw. This small screw actually controls how much fuel you are getting when strictly idling. It’s usually placed underneath the carb body on the engine side of the throttle plate. Screwing this screw in effectively cuts off fuel, and screwing it out allows more fuel in. 

As soon as you open the throttle past 1/4, the setting on the screw does not affect how the engine runs, so it’s basically only used to set the fuel-air ratio of your idle. For example, on Harley Davidsons, I like running my idles a bit rich because they are air-cooled. I do this to prevent overheating! 

### Carburetor Types

Now, hopefully, you understand the different circuits of the carb: idle, low-speed, midrange, and wide-open. Below you will find a graph attached showing you which jets (or screws) are feeding what circuits most heavily. 

Now is a fantastic time to also bring up the main types of carburetors. The two main types are variable venturi (Constant Velocity), and fixed velocity carburetors. Don’t let these names scare you. A fixed venturi carburetor simply uses a variable slide in the middle of the carburetor that keeps the air moving through it at a constant velocity. This slide is connected directly to engine vacuum, so as engine vacuum increases, the slide opens more. This movement of the slide keeps the air moving through the carburetor at the same speed at all times. 

Some variable venturi carburetors also have that same slide not connected to engine vacuum, but the throttle drive cable, thus acting as both a variable venturi and a throttle plate. These are very common on dirt bikes. Fixed venturi carburetors have no slides, and the venturi is simply controlled by the casting of the carburetor body. These are common on cars, but we won’t really be covering them here.

### Carburetor Bowl and Other Components

Other important aspects of the carb include the bowl, which is at the bottom of the carburetor and essentially acts as a small fuel tank. This is where the jets draw from. Inside the carb bowl also lives the float and float needle. The float, as the name implies, floats on top of the gasoline and once it hits a certain point, it pushes the float needle closed to keep fuel from entering the carburetor. The float and float needle act as a metering source for the flow of fuel.

It’s also important to note that float height is crucial, as it has a significant impact on the overall air-fuel ratio. The higher the fuel level in the carb bowl, the more fuel will be drawn, and the richer the engine will run. Lowering the float height lessens the fuel level, resulting in a leaner mixture.

The idle speed screw is also important, as it allows the user to raise or lower the idle speed by manually opening the throttle plate in small increments.

Other circuits in the carburetor include the air cut-off circuit and an intermediate circuit. The air cut-off circuit essentially serves to prevent a lean backfire (which is caused when you engine-brake) by enriching the mixture when exhaust braking. This works because the most amount of engine vacuum will be produced when you are exhaust braking. This vacuum force can then open a small spring-operated orifice that allows more fuel into the combustion chamber.

You won’t see these often on road bikes, but usually, you’ll see them on four-wheelers and larger dirt bikes. Another important circuit to know is the midrange circuit. Most carburetors will only have that velocity needle, which mostly impacts your midrange, but on some carburetors (like four-wheeler carbs), you will see a third jet in the bowl. This jet serves as a quick-response fuel source for throttle input, such as a rev.

Carburetors for most road bikes include an injection pump that squirts a shot of fuel into the intake manifold when the throttle is quickly opened. Carburetors without this will sometimes include that third jet to give you quick, no-load throttle response. A lot of carburetors don’t include these measures, and when under no-load or light-load conditions, the engine may stumble when transitioning quickly from no throttle to wide-open throttle. This forces the user to decrease the speed at which they open the throttle.

Most Harley Davidson carburetors found on Evo and Twin Cam motor platforms will be using a constant velocity carburetor that is very similar to what I described above.

### The Air Bleed

The final thing I wish to discuss about carburetors before I get into specific troubleshooting is the air bleed. On the air side of the carb (what is connected to the air filter), you will normally see two little holes near the bottom lip. These holes serve as air passages to the jets, which allows for atomization of the fuel before it gets to the intake manifold. This is important because it provides the engine with a much better charge. These holes are just important to clean and rarely have any issues associated with them.

### Common Carburetor Errors

1. **The vehicle operates perfectly fine in a certain RPM range but doesn’t operate well in any other range.** This issue is 99% of the time caused by a clogged jet related to that RPM range. If the vehicle idles fine but won’t go into full throttle, this could be your main jet. It's best practice to clean all your jets and make sure you can see light through them.

2. **The idle stays high and gradually comes back down when you rev the motorcycle.** This is almost certainly caused by an air-fuel idle screw that is turned in too much, causing a lean condition. This could also be caused by a pilot jet that is too small.

3. **Checking Spark Plugs:** If you use spark plugs to determine your air-fuel ratio in stages, here’s how to check:
   - If you wish to check your idle AFR, let the vehicle idle for 5-10 minutes without any throttle input and check the plugs.
   - To check the midrange AFR, perform some midrange speeds, shut off the bike, and pop it in neutral to come to a complete stop. Hopefully, you get the idea that you will have to shut the bike off before it transitions into any other circuit to test individual circuits!

4. **Full throttle popping or bogging.** This is usually caused by a lean condition in the midrange circuit, pilot circuit, or idle fuel screw. Most commonly, this results from a combination of a lean pilot and lean idle fuel.

A great way to rule out these overlapping circuits is to perform your diagnostic tests in a range where the smallest amount of influence is seen from any other circuit.

### How Carburetors Work

Carburetors operate on the principle of the **Venturi Effect**, which means that when air (or any fluid) is restricted, its velocity increases, and a low-pressure zone is created. This low-pressure area is crucial for fuel delivery. Carburetors consist of two main parts: the body and the bowl.

- **Carburetor Body**: The body has passages that allow fuel to travel from the bowl to the low-pressure areas. Air is restricted at two points:
  1. **Carb body constriction**: The body of the carb narrows in the center, creating a low-pressure zone.
  2. **Throttle plate**: When the throttle is closed, the air is severely restricted, creating a strong vacuum (low-pressure area). As the throttle opens, this low-pressure area shifts to the middle of the carb body.

Fuel is drawn through small holes near these restricted areas and delivered to the engine.

### Fuel Circuits

The carburetor is designed with different circuits that control fuel delivery at various throttle positions:

1. **Idle Circuit**: When the throttle is closed, fuel flows through small holes near the throttle plate.
2. **Midrange Circuit**: As the throttle opens, the velocity needle (a small straw-like component) adjusts fuel flow, allowing fuel to be drawn from the main jet.
3. **Wide Open Throttle Circuit**: When the throttle is fully open, fuel is drawn through holes near the middle of the carb body.

Each circuit corresponds to a specific RPM range. The idle circuit is used at low RPM, the midrange circuit is used for cruising speeds, and the wide open throttle circuit is used when the engine is at full power.

### Fuel Metering

Fuel is metered by jets, which are essentially small holes that limit the amount of fuel that can be drawn into the engine. There are two main jets:
- **Pilot Jet**: Controls fuel flow in the idle and low-speed circuits.
- **Main Jet**: Controls fuel flow at high speeds.

At mid-range speeds, the pilot jet works with the velocity needle, which adjusts the fuel flow from the main jet as the throttle opens.

### Additional Components

- **Float and Float Needle**: The float controls fuel level in the carb bowl. When the float rises, it pushes the float needle closed, stopping the flow of fuel.
- **Idle Speed Screw**: This screw adjusts the idle speed by controlling the amount of air entering the carburetor at idle.
- **Air Cut-off Circuit**: This prevents lean backfire during engine braking by enriching the mixture when engine vacuum is high.
- **Intermediate Circuit**: Found in some carburetors, this circuit provides quick fuel transitions between throttle changes (commonly used on dirt bikes and quads).

### Types of Carburetors

There are two main types of carburetors:
- **Variable Venturi (Constant Velocity)**: These carburetors adjust airflow to maintain a constant velocity, often seen on dirt bikes. The throttle slide is controlled by engine vacuum or the throttle cable.
- **Fixed Venturi**: These carburetors have a fixed shape and do not adjust for constant airflow. They are typically used in cars and are not covered in detail here.
