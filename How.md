## Carburetors (Carbs)
I wanted to make this page dedicated to telling others what I wish someone had told me. I also dislike watching videos on things because they are usually way to drawn out and include useless infromation. Anyhow this section is dedicated to teaching everyone about Carbs. The importance behind this is Carbs account for most issues you will have on your small engines, anything from black smoke to popping in your exhaust system. A classic carbuerator sympton is when the engine may idle propley, or run correctly in some rpm range, but when taken out of that rpm range it begins to stumble or die. **NOTE THAT THE EASIEST WAY TO PREVENT CARB ISSUES IS BY CHANGING THE AIR FILTER, FUEL FILTER, AND RUNNING NON-EHTANOL!!!!**. Any how let me give you some context on how Carbuerators actually work. Carbuerators rely on a principle known as the Venturi Effect, which is basically a fancy way of saying that when we can restrict the flow of air or any fluid, it will do two important things. First the velocity (speed) of the fluid or air (in our case I will be refering to air as thats what carbs deal with) increases, and where the constraint is a low preassure zone is also created. Now its imporatnt to note that this is a low preassure zone compared to atmospheric pressaure. We will skip over the speed effect for right now as that less important but refer back to this low preasure zone. The carbuerator is comprised of 2 main sections, the body and the bowl. The Body (shown below). Is futhuered comprised of many passages withing the alumium these passages serve as tubes provinding direct path from the fuel (thats kept in the bowl) to these low preassure zones created in 2 main areas. This is a very important concept to understand, as this is the principle in which carbs can function. Air is restricted in two main areas, first is the constriction in the casting of the carb body, you can see this in the photo below as one end is very wide, the other end is wide but the middle is much smaller. This provides a constriction of air, that creates an area of low preassure. The second constriction is actually the throttle plate. Depending on how "open" the throttle there is a low preassure zone. For example at idle when you have a fully close throttle the air is severly restricted causing a very strong "vaccum" (fancy way of saying area of low pressure). There are conviently small holes connected to the passages right near the throttle plate that utilize this low preassure to draw fuel from the bowl that is then delivered to the engine. Consider as you gradually open the throttle though, and this plate continually restricts the air less and less. While this is happening that low preassure area becomes less appeant, but the natrual constriction in the carb body becomes more prounced leading to the low pressure zone being in the middle of the carb body instead of near the throttle plate. Conviently there are holes there as well that allows fuel to travel. NOW it is important to note that fuel is still being drawn by the small holes near the throttle plate, but not enough to consider. So this brings the concept of circuits into the picture. When ever anyone talks about a carbuerator fuel circuit they are referring to where this area of low preassure is more pronounced. Where it gets complicated is that these circuits also heavily over lap, but there are 2 circuits in which the effects of the other circuits arent apprent. The first being your idle circuit. The throttle plate is completly closed and almost all your fuel is moving through the small holes near the throttle plate. The next is your wide open throttle circuit. At this time the throttle is complety opened causing the majority of your fuel coming from the holes near the middle of the carb body. Now is a good time to move onto how the fuel is actually metered, and its done using these small straw like things called "Jets". The Jets are based in certain sizes that effectivly limit the amount of fuel that can be sucked. There are two main jets, the pilot, which controls your low speed circuits, and the main jet which controls your high speed circuits. Its worth metioning that another important element for fuel metering for your mid range speeds. When ever you arent going full speed or idling your pilot jet is working with something known as your velocity needle. This needle sits in the passage leading to your main jet (also called the emulsion tube, picture of that later, just know its a fancy version of these passages). As you gradully open the throttle this needle slides up allowing more and more fuel to be deliverd from the main jet as the low pressure zone in the middle of the carb body (this natrual constraint we discused above) increases. So know he have discussed the three main circuits, idle, midrange, and wide open. Its important to note that the mid range circuit is heavily influenced by the pilot jet. Most of the time in normal driving scenrioas you will most always be pulling heavily from the idle ciruit and midrange circuit. Another thing I must metion is the effect of the idle fuel screw. This small screw actually controls how much fuel you are getting when strictly idling. Its USUALLY placed underneath the carb body on the engine side of the throttle plate. Screwing this screw in effectivly cuts off fuel, and screwing out effectively allows more fuel in. As soon as you open the throttle pased 1/4 the setting on the screw does not effect how the engine runs, so its basically only used to set the fuel air ratio of your idle. For example on Harley Davidsons I like running my idles a bit rich because they are air cooled, I do this to prevent over heating! Sorry have to return to work will finsih this!
