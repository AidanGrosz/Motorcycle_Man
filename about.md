My name is Aidan Grosz, and I’m a junior at the University of Florida studying Electrical Engineering. My journey into mechanics started years ago when I began working on small engines to learn more about how they work. I quickly became passionate about the complexity of engine parts. Although I didn’t get my first small engine back together perfectly, those early experiences laid the foundation for everything I know now.

From there, I expanded into working on larger engines, starting with a 2001 Ford Mustang I bought for $900. The seller said the engine was beyond repair, but after some diagnostic work, I found that the problem was a cracked exhaust valve. I pulled the heads, worked with a machine shop, and reassembled the engine—what I later learned was a $1,300 job that I did myself. That Mustang also introduced me to automotive electrical work, as it had several faulty sensors that I tested and replaced independently.

Over the years, I’ve worked on a wide variety of engines, from boats and military-grade generators to motorcycles, forklifts, classic cars, and diesel trucks. Lately, my focus has shifted to building and customizing Harleys from the ground up, which requires expertise in automotive spray painting, engine and transmission building, and advanced electrical systems, especially when it comes to converting ignition systems.

This isn’t just a hobby for me—I spend 40-50 hours a week working on projects, not counting the countless hours I spent learning the ropes in the beginning. I also sell my completed projects to fund future ones, and I continue to do repair work. Through community outreach, I teach others about mechanics, hoping to pass on the knowledge I’ve gained.

Everything I’ve learned is self-taught. I didn’t have access to expert mentors or fancy tools, but I’ve funded my own learning journey, and now I’m focused on continuing to expand my knowledge and help others along the way.
