### Cue Real Gone!
Hopefully, you can hear the song I associate with this motorcycle. Much like the movie Cars, which ignited my passion for the engineering behind fast-moving vehicles, the Harley-Davidson Sportster ignited my passion for all Harleys. This was my second road motorcycle, but my first Harley. I instantly fell in love with its sleek, bobber-like design, the rubber-mounted V-Twin, and the classic Harley-Davidson sound.

It’s funny because many people consider the Sportster to be a second-rate Harley, but it’s actually the only Harley model that hasn’t changed since its inception. The Sportster is the one bike that has truly stayed true to its roots, offering riders a unique and sporty riding experience. In my personal opinion, it’s the last "true" Harley-Davidson.

Let’s go over the basics. This Harley is the only mass-produced 45-degree V-Twin with a married transmission and engine. Most of the Big Twin models have a divorced engine and transmission, but to reduce production costs and weight, the engineers at Harley chose this traditional engine configuration. The Sportster also boasts one of the highest ride heights, allowing riders to lean into corners without scraping the pegs or pipes.

The Sportster platform offers both an 883cc and 1200cc powerplant, putting out anywhere from 51 to 60 horsepower. What’s impressive about the Sportster is its ability to rev higher and reach peak revs faster than any of the Big Twin platforms, giving it a competitive advantage in that RPM range.

## The Journey:
This Sportster is my most reliable Harley-Davidson, featuring a classic carbureted 1200cc powerplant. That being said, I’ve certainly had my hands dirty working on it. When I originally purchased the motorcycle, the previous owner claimed he was selling it because the ignition timing was off, resulting in backfiring through the carburetor. As soon as I saw this, I knew it was a carburetor issue because motorcycles generally don’t have variable ignition systems and rely on a stock timing curve determined by the CDI box.

Getting the bike running again was easy, as the problem was a velocity needle that had come unclipped and was sitting fully in the main jet, causing a lean pop when the bike was revved. The simplicity of carburetors is clear once you understand them, but getting to know them is the hard part. Having worked on carburetors nearly my entire life, I can quickly recognize common issues and fix them. This speaks to my ability to learn new technologies and my motivation (recruiters, that’s for you). I plan to dedicate an entire page to explaining how carburetors work for those still learning, and hopefully, others can learn from my mistakes.

Once the Sportster was running, I realized there was more work ahead than I originally thought. The derby cover bolts on the primary cover were all stripped, preventing me from adjusting the clutch or changing the oil. I fixed this by removing the primary cover and drilling out the old bolts.

All Harleys suffer from what I call "weak starter syndrome." Due to the engine's high compression ratio, they often experience starter kickback, which occurs when the starter doesn’t have enough torque to push the cylinder through the compression stroke, causing the piston to come back down. This puts immense force on the starter clutch, resulting in a grinding sound. The easiest fix is to replace the starter with a higher-output model (usually 1.4 kW from 1.2 kW), which not only replaces the starter clutch but also gives the starter motor more torque. The cheaper option is simply replacing the starter clutch, which is what I did.

While rebuilding the starter with the new clutch wasn’t difficult, I overlooked the quality of the clutch. I like to call cheap aftermarket parts "Chineseium." The problem with the starter clutch I purchased was that the gears didn’t mesh with the starter ring gear, causing some teeth to be stripped off after just three starts. This meant I had to replace not only the starter clutch again but also the clutch basket, as the ring gear is riveted to it. This repair was both labor-intensive and costly, with the basket costing over $300 and requiring the entire primary to be disassembled. This included removing and reinstalling both the clutch basket and flywheel bolts, which require over 150 foot-pounds of torque. To complete this job, I had to engineer a device to hold both the flywheel and clutch basket in place while removing these nuts. I successfully completed the job, which marked a major milestone in my Harley-Davidson career. To this day, I have had no issues with the ring gear, starter, or flywheel.

I used this motorcycle as reliable transportation throughout my freshman year, but when summer came, I decided it was time for my first (of many) Harley-Davidson engine overhauls. This included removing both the jugs and cylinder heads, and replacing all the gaskets. Disassembling the top end of a Harley is unusually simple as they aren't burdened with unnecessary sensors and electronics. The robust pushrod design also helps, as all you need to consider are bleed-down times, something I’ll discuss later. I won’t bore you with all the details of the disassembly, but one key consideration is getting the cylinders to top dead center (TDC) before attempting to remove the rocker assembly.

Where things got interesting was during reassembly. I worked with J&K Machine Shop to have the cylinders honed, the heads and jugs resurfaced, and the valves lapped and cleaned. There was nearly 1/8 inch of carbon on both the pistons and cylinder heads due to excessive oil entering the combustion cycle from the breathers. Unlike Big Twin models, these Harley engines don't prevent raw oil from entering the intake. I addressed this by designing a brilliant rerouting system to send all crankcase ventilation to the atmosphere.

I originally intended to stick with the stock pistons and new rings, but tragically, I cut too deep into the cylinder wall while installing the jugs. I was naïve and used a cheap pair of piston ring compressors, which led to the damage. Unlike conventional car engines, Harley jugs must be placed over the pistons and then forced down. The general rule is that if the cut is deep enough to catch a fingernail, you’ll have compression issues and burn oil. Needless to say, this setback was frustrating, as I had already spent a lot of money on the jug work and now had to go oversize, including new pistons. This was an expensive lesson, but one that contributed to my education.

I invested in the JIMS Piston Ring Installer tool, had the jugs bored out to .005 oversized, and went with a set of Wiseco pistons. I successfully rebuilt my first Harley engine shortly afterward. There was certainly more involved in this project than I can write here, so I’ll dedicate another section to that.

Since then, the only major work I’ve done on the Sportster (apart from simple carburetor rejetting) is a cosmetic overhaul. This includes powder coating all previously powder-coated parts, repainting the bike, and lowering the rear by 3 inches. I’m designing the bike to have a more pronounced bobber look with a lowered stance. I’m also leaving behind my love for black and chrome, opting for a more minimalist paint scheme. This includes a metallic tank and blacked-out rear and front fenders. Additionally, I’m powder coating the pipes flat black to complement the minimalist look. Lastly, I’m chopping the rear fender for that bobber style!
