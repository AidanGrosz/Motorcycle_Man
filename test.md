Hello all viewers, this is the first post of many. The idea of this website is to show you all what I do, which I explain in more detail in the about section. Understand there is a lot that I won't post as the work I do can get very deep. As always, if interested, reach out to me for more information and help with whatever projects you all may be working on!

### Goals:
- Finish radiator on Chevy Sonic for client
- Spray base/clear coat on rear fender for Harley Sportster build
- Sand gas tank flat and remove dents for Harley Sportster build
- Design painting stand for all parts

### Accomplished:
- Radiator
- Spray painting (but there were issues)
- Sanding/removing dents (on GitHub)
- Design painting stand

Unfortunaly I did not take any photos for today except for my painting stand:
